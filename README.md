# First Claude Code Experiment

This is a simple Go application that demonstrates basic Go programming concepts. The program prints "Hello, Davis Kids!" to the console when executed.

## What it does

The application consists of a single `main.go` file that uses Go's standard `fmt` package to output a greeting message. It serves as a foundational example for learning Go development workflows and testing practices.
